# guess-the-word

Project created in Javascript course in the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) [Break Into Tech](https://skillcrush.com/break-into-tech-blueprint) program.

Practiced TDD in writing logic functions. Test coverage does not include click functions that require full DOM rendering.  Tests written in Jest.  Also experimented with Mocha but did not end up using it in main (see mocha branch).
