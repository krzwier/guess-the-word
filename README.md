# guess-the-word

Project created in Javascript course in the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) [Break Into Tech](https://skillcrush.com/break-into-tech-blueprint) program.

Practiced TDD in working on this project.  Test coverage is 100%, including both UI and logic.  Tests written in Jest.  Also experimented with Mocha but did not end up using it in main (see mocha branch).
