# guess-the-word

This is a game app where the user inputs letters to guess a word randomly pulled from an API.  It was a course project from the Javascript course in the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) fast-track developer program.

I went beyond the assignment specifications by practicing TDD as I worked on this project.  It took me some time to learn how to write tests for DOM manipulation, but I learned a lot in the process. Test coverage is 100%, including both UI and logic.  Tests are written in Jest.  I also experimented with Mocha but did not end up using it in the main branch (see mocha branch).
